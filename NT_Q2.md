# Statement of Purpose (SOP)

## Goals and Motivations
My passion for Artificial Intelligence stems from its limitless potential to solve real-world problems. I am particularly eager to participate in **AI hackathons** to broaden my practical knowledge and explore innovative applications. The thrill of turning theoretical concepts into impactful solutions excites me, and I believe this community will provide the perfect platform to collaborate, learn, and grow.

## Relevant Background
As a member of the **IIT B Racing Team (Driverless Division)**, I’ve worked extensively with AI, including **YOLO-based object detection** for identifying cones in autonomous vehicle navigation. Additionally, I completed a project on **"Market Sentiment Analysis using LSTM Neural Networks,"** where I trained models to predict stock market trends from textual data. Beyond formal projects, I’ve **self-taught machine learning and deep learning** through online courses and hands-on experimentation. Currently, I’m expanding my skills into **data-intensive applications** to tackle scalability challenges in AI systems. These experiences have given me hands-on exposure to machine learning frameworks, data preprocessing, and model optimization.

## Contributions and Learning Goals
I am committed to contributing **hard work, teamwork, and creative problem-solving** to help the community achieve excellence. I hope to gain **hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools**, collaborate on projects with real-world impact, and learn from peers and mentors. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical implementation, pushing the boundaries of what AI can accomplish.

I am eager to embark on this journey with the AI community and contribute to its collective success.
