# AI Hackathon Preparation Timeline (1-Month Plan)

*Author's Note: I'm new to AI hackathons but very eager to participate. This plan represents my what I have found on how to prepare effectively.*

## Week 1: Problem Selection & Team Formation

### Days 1-3: Understanding Hackathon Themes
- Research announced hackathon themes/tracks
- Identify 3-5 potential problem areas of interest
- Study past winners' projects in similar hackathons
- **Deliverable:** Ranked list of potential problem areas

### Days 4-5: Problem Formulation
- Convert broad ideas into specific, measurable AI problems
- Ensure problems are:
  - Solvable within hackathon duration
  - Have measurable success metrics
  - Potentially impactful


### Days 6-7: Team Assembly & Roles
- Define roles:
  - Data Engineer (data pipelines)
  - ML Engineer (model development)
  - Frontend Developer (demo creation)
  - Project Manager (timeline tracking)


## Week 2: Data & Exploration

### Days 8-10: Data Sourcing
- Identify potential datasets:
  - Kaggle, UCI ML Repo, government/open data portals
  - APIs (Twitter, Google, etc.)
  - Synthetic data generation if needed
- **Deliverable:** Dataset(s) secured with access documented

### Days 11-12: Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, outliers
- Normalization/standardization
- Feature engineering
- Create train/validation/test splits
- **Tooling:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

### Days 13-14: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries
- Visualization (distributions, correlations)
- Identify data quality issues
- **Deliverable:** EDA notebook with key insights

## Week 3: Model Development

### Days 15-16: Baseline Models
- Implement simple models (linear regression, decision trees)
- Establish performance benchmarks
- **Success Metric:** Outperform naive baselines

### Days 17-19: Advanced Model Experimentation
- Test 2-3 complex approaches:
  - Neural networks (if applicable)
  - Ensemble methods
  - Pretrained models (BERT, ResNet, etc.)
- **Compute Strategy:** Use free tiers (Google Colab, Kaggle GPUs)

### Days 20-21: Model Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature selection
- Cross-validation
- **Deliverable:** Model with best validation performance

## Week 4: Refinement & Presentation

### Days 22-23: Integration
- Build pipeline from raw data to predictions
- Create minimal viable demo (Streamlit/Gradio)

### Days 24-25: Evaluation & Metrics
- Final testing on holdout set
- Prepare clear evaluation metrics
- Identify limitations honestly

### Days 26-27: Presentation Prep
- Create 3-5 slide deck covering:
  - Problem importance
  - Solution approach
  - Results
- Practice pitch

### Days 28-29: Dry Run
- Complete end-to-end rehearsal
- Time all components
- Fix last-minute issues

### Day 30: Final Preparation
- Verify all submission requirements
- Prepare development environment backups

## Key Considerations for Beginners

1. **Scope Control:** Better a complete simple solution than incomplete complex one
2. **Documentation:** Comment code thoroughly for team collaboration
3. **Version Control:** Use Git from Day 1
4. **Judging Criteria:** Align solution with hackathon's evaluation metrics
5. **Learning Focus:** Prioritize learning over winning in first hackathon

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Data unavailable | Identify 2-3 backup datasets |
| Model not converging | Prepare simpler fallback approaches |
| Team member drops | Document all work collaboratively |
| Compute limitations | Test early on target platform |
| Last-minute bugs | Build in 1-2 buffer days |
